## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: Flow characteristics of convergent divergent nozzle at supersonic and subsonic speeds

### 1. Story Outline:
The objective of this setup is to understand the basic operation of a typical convergent divergent nozzle (C-D nozzle) or de Laval nozzle. 


### 2. Story:

Understanding of the flow regimes inside a C-D nozzle is utmost important to aeronautics students, as these nozzles are widely associated with aerospace propulsion and high-speed flow of gases. 
This lab experiment is designed to help students to visualize the flow through C-D nozzle at different range of operating conditions.
The set-up consists of,

Apparatus
1.	storage tank
2.	settling chamber and a CD nozzle section with presure ports
3.	The pressure regulator, used to control the pressure in the settling chamber



#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
Generally, gas flows from high pressure region to low pressure region. Hence in this setup the gas moves from storage chamber (high pressure region) to the converging part of the nozzle (low pressure region). Chamber pressure is denoted by the symbol Pc. 
CD nozzle is basically a convergent duct followed by a divergent duct. There is a minimum cross-sectional area between the convergent and divergent portions which is known as throat. 
Gas flows from the chamber reaches converging portion of the nozzle, and the throat, then exit through the diverging portion as a jet. 
Ambient pressure is often referred as back pressure and given the symbol Pb. Based on the ambient (or) back pressure conditions, one can expect the nozzle to exhibit the following flow patterns: Subsonic flow, choked flow, Shock in diverging section, Shock at exit section, Overexpansion, Optimum expansion, Under expansion.
<br>
Case 1 - Subsonic pattern (nozzle isn’t choked): If the back pressure is lowered slightly (from that of chamber condition), the flow accelerates out of the chamber through the converging section, reaching its maximum (subsonic) speed at the throat. The flow then decelerates through the diverging section and exhausts into the ambient as a subsonic jet. 
Case 2 - Choked flow: When the back pressure is lowered further than that of in case 1, the flow pattern is exactly the same as in subsonic flow, except that the flow speed at the throat is Mach 1.
Case 3 - Shock at diverging section: As the back pressure is lowered below that needed to just choke the flow, a region of supersonic flow forms just downstream of the throat (diverging section). This region of supersonic acceleration is terminated by a normal shock wave. After the shock the flow in the jet will be subsonic.
Case 4 - Over expansion: Lowering the back pressure further causes the shock to bend out into the jet and a complex pattern of shocks and reflections is set up in the jet. Since the shock is no longer perpendicular to the flow near the nozzle walls, it deflects it inward as it leaves the exit. In this case nozzle exit pressure is lower than the back pressure (Pe<Pb).
Case 5 - Optimum expansion: The isentropic expansion takes place only when the back pressure matches with the correct one for which the nozzle is designed. (Pe = Pb).
Case 6 - Under expansion: When the back pressure is lowered further, nozzle exit pressure becomes higher than the back pressure (Pe>Pb). Such condition is called as under expansion.



#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
1. The primary objective of the experiment is to visualize the effect of pressure ratio on the flow in convergent divergent nozzle. 
2. To understand the operating characteristics of a De Laval Nozzle with the decreasing back pressure.
3. To understand the nozzle operating at different conditions like Under-Expanded, Correctly-Expanded and Over-Expanded conditions
4. To identify the settling chamber pressure required to attend the designed Mach condition
5. To understand the importance of the choking condition of De Laval Nozzle 
6. Plot the graph for distance along the De Laval Nozzle axis (x-axis) versus pressure ratio (y-axis)
7. Attempt the assessment questions (Quizzes)  


#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

1. Open the pressure valve, where the settling chamber pressure varies by opening of the valve
2. Note down the initial settling chamber pressure value
3. Set Cp/Cv=1.4, fix the Ae/At value.
3. Change the back pressure to settling chamber pressure ratio (.0125 to 1) to operate the flow in De Laval Nozzle
4. Control the pressure ratio to obtain the various flow characteristics through nozzle
5. Using formula, calculate the pressure ratio theoretically for Mach=2 
6. Once the “Result table” is complete, click on the “Plot the graph” button the graph for distance along the De Laval Nozzle axis vs pressure ratio will be generated.
