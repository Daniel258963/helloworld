###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
•	Equipment involved in conducting the experiments. <br>
•	Explanation of step by step procedure of the experiment. <br>
•	Controlling various equipment to start the experiment. <br>
•	Controlling the settling chamber pressure to alter the nozzle flow. <br>
•	Understanding the nozzle flow and different conditions like Under-Expanded, Correctly-Expanded and Over-Expanded conditions. <br>
•	Procedure to use the Isentropic and Area-Mach number relations to calculate the desired flow in the CD nozzle. <br>
